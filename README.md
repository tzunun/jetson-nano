# Jetson Nano Information

### These instructions work with Ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04. And should work with other Unix-like operating systems with slight modifications (if any).  I have attempted to provide information for Windows users but your experience may be different.

***It is my intention to document a way to accomplish these tasks, however I make
no presumptions that the information contained here is the most elegant,
effective or the only way to do this.***

***I hope that these instructions provide you with more complete instructions than some available options, since there seems to be a barrier just to get started and
there will be more obstacles along the way.  This is my attempt to help
others.***

## Jetson Nano Initial Headless Setup
**No keyboard, no monitor and no mouse? No problem!**

Most hardware vendors assume that you have the budget and the space for additional keyboards, monitors and mouse(mice?).  But what if you only have a computer(desktop or laptop) and the budget for a Jetson Nano, the required SD Card and 5V 4A power supply?

Well, check out [Headless Jetson Nano](https://github.com/tzunun/jetson-nano/blob/master/headeless-nano.md).

## Jetson Nano GUI (XFCE)
**Accessing a GUI (graphical user interface) on the Jetson Nano from your computer.***

So you have setup a headless Jetson Nano, No additional Keyboard, Mouse and Keyboard required.  But you can only interact with it from the command line and you need a Graphical User Interface.  No problem!

Check out [Jetson Nano GUI from you computer](https://github.com/tzunun/jetson-nano/blob/master/x2go.md).

***Notice*** that this is not the default Jetson Nano GUI.
